Order &amp; Customer Data Analysis and Prediction

This project performs a comprehensive analysis and machine learning on an e-commerce dataset, focusing on orders, customers, products, and delivery performance. The data is loaded from multiple CSV files, with basic exploration provided, such as checking the shape of each dataset and identifying missing values. Missing data is handled by filling categorical columns with "Unknown", numerical columns with their median values, and date columns with a proper datetime format. The analysis includes visualizing the trend of orders over time, plotting the number of orders per day, and examining customer data, including the distribution of customer ages (if the "age" column is available). The project also analyzes product performance by identifying the top 10 best-selling products and checking the inventory for low stock items. Delivery performance is evaluated by calculating the average delivery time and visualizing its distribution.
On the machine learning side, the project includes demand prediction using a RandomForestRegressor, with features such as the date converted to numerical values based on the days since the first order. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Additionally, the project uses KMeans clustering to segment customers based on their age and purchase frequency, followed by a visualization of these customer segments, with the silhouette score calculated to assess clustering quality. Finally, the processed data is saved into a specified directory for further use. This project provides insights into e-commerce data, helping to understand trends, predict future demand, and segment customers for targeted marketing.
